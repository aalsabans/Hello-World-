    <p>There are three important and main points in order to have the best cup of coffee ever:
  The type of coffee used to prepare the coffee drink is one of the most influential factors in determining the type of your coffee in terms of taste, strength, and even the percentage of caffeine in it. Arabica coffee and Robusta coffee are used in the preparation of many types of coffee, and it is considered one of the most famous types of coffee and is used in various international companies such as Tim Hortons coffee and Lavazza coffee, and also local Saudi companies such as Al-Ameed coffee and Baja coffee.</p>

  <p>The coffee roasting stage is one of the most important stages of coffee preparation, where the coffee is roasted at a certain temperature and a specific time to control the final taste of the coffee. This stage greatly affects the flavor of the coffee and the degree of bitterness, so you have to make sure that the coffee is roasted in the right way to get the real taste of any type of coffee.</p>

  <p>Grinding coffee depending on the degree of grinding, the grinder used, and the brewing method, the coffee bean can give off a variety of flavours. By purchasing and grinding coffee yourself, you are ensuring a level of freshness that pre-ground coffee does not provide. The outside of the coffee bean preserves the oils and aromas stored in the coffee bean. Once ground these oils can begin to evaporate in order to get the most out of your coffee, it is always a good idea to grind the coffee beans yourself right before the brewing process to get the perfect coffee extraction. Making great coffee involves using water to extract the flavor of the bean. The temperature of the water, the grind of the bean, and the length of time the two come into contact determine how strong, weak, or mild the coffee is.</p>
